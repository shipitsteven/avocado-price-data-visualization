# Avocado price data visualization

> This dataset is from Kaggle.com, the original source can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices).

This repository is a demonstration of simple data visualization using `Python`, and some popular libraries such as `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `seaborn`. 

These files were part of the final project for the course CS110 - *Introduction of Computer Programming* @ North Seattle College. It was the very first programming class I took.

In the script, there's a helper function that generate random avocado prices within a given range. It also replies with a snarky comments to sprinkle a little sense of humor to this quick project.

Thanks for reading to the end! ðŸ˜ƒ
